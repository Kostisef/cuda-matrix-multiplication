# cuda-matrix-multiplication
A CUDA approach for computing the multiplication of a transposed matrix with the initial one.

This repository contains three different implementations for computing the <span>A<sup>T</sup>&sdot;A</span> using the cuBLAS library.
* cuBLASDgemm implementation
* Simple implementation
* Simple implementation with shared memory
